# Choose a Project

This week, you will be in a team of two or three people working on a project. You should use [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to keep track of what needs to be done and who is working on what. Your team should use [feature branches](https://bocoup.com/blog/git-workflow-walkthrough-feature-branches) for development.

Use your combined creativity and common sense to make decisions as you work. Users expect to see some common features in web applications. If they are not mentioned in the project's description, you should still do them. For example: in the code snippet application, users should have avatar images. You don't have to handle file uploads yourself -- you could use Gravatar with [django-gravatar](https://github.com/twaddington/django-gravatar) -- but you need some way of handling that.

In addition to those small features, come up with your own features to make your project unique. You will likely use this project in your portfolio, so make it stand out!

# Rules for all projects

* Your application should be styled. It should be usable and aesthetically neutral, at a minimum. You can use a library or you can write custom css, or both. It is up to you.
* Your application should be able to run from scratch by downloading the repo, running `pipenv install`, `pipenv shell`, `python manage.py migrate`, and `python manage.py runserver`. If there are any other steps necessary, please put them in a README.md file. In other words, document this project like a professional would.

## Stretch goal for each project: trying new things

Teams should consider trying something they don't know how to do on their project. This could be a Python or JavaScript library they haven't used before or a feature of Django they haven't tried.

# The Projects

## Project 1: Code Snippet Manager

You need a good way to manage snippets of code you reuse often. You are going to build a web application that has these goals:

* Registered users can add code snippets.
* Registered users can search their own code snippets and get results.
* Each user has a profile page that shows their public code snippets. Other users can copy a snippet with one click, adding it to their library of snippets.

### How snippets work

A snippet has code (required), a language (required), a title (optional), and whatever other fields make sense. Some ideas to consider: a description or a list of tags.

If you copy a snippet by clicking the copy button (or whatever UI element is used for this purpose), there's a link back to the original snippet. The easiest way to do this is with a foreign key. One should be able to see how many times a snippet has been copied.

The reason why we copy snippets instead of "favorite" them is that they can change. The original snippet creator can edit their snippet; the copying user can edit their copy.

### How search works

Search should look for terms in the title, in other fields like a description or tags, and in the language field. If I search for "javascript auth," I should see any snippets I have about authentication using JavaScript. See [search](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/search/) and [full text search](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/postgres/search/) in the Django documentation for some ideas.

### How much of this is JavaScript?

This can vary, but the two parts that _definitely_ need JavaScript are syntax highlighting and copying a code snippet to your clipboard.

For syntax highlighting, check out [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) or [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

See [this article on native browser copy to clipboard](https://css-tricks.com/native-browser-copy-clipboard/) for ideas on how to copy to clipboard.

## Project 2: Habit Tracker

For this project, you will build a Django application that you can use to help track and reinforce daily habits.

* Your application should have registration and login.
* Users should be able to create a new habit tracker. Each habit should have a name and a target or goal. What is this "target"? Each habit should have a daily number of some action you want to do. Some examples:
  * I want to walk 1000 steps daily
  * I want to write 100 lines of code daily
  * I want to talk to 2 new people each day
  * I want to read 200 pages daily
  * I want to sleep 8 hours daily
* Once you have habits, you should be able to make a daily record of your activity on each habit. That record should contain a date and a number for that date.
* A user can only have one record per day per habit. You will need to use [the `unique_together` option](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/options/#unique-together) to enforce this.
* Optimally, users can edit/update records and add records for previous days.
* Make your interface for this feature as easy to use as possible. For example, if you can choose the date for your record, have it default to the current date.
* On the detail page for a habit, you should be able to see all the records for that habit in an HTML table. Show the user whether they met their goal for that day visually somehow -- maybe via colors. Think about accessibility here -- how would a user that can't see know whether they met their goal each day?

### Some stretch goals for this project

* Add a line chart to the detail page for a habit showing your records for the last 30 days.
* On the detail page for a habit, show the best day for that habit, and the average day for that habit.
* When you list the records for a habit, show any days that don't have a record that are between the first and last record. For example, if there's a record for June 28 and a record for June 30, show June 29 as well and highlight that it has missing data. Provide a way to fill in that data easily.
* Add the ability to have "negative habits." These habits should have a goal you want to get under. For example:
  * I want to watch less than 60 minutes of TV daily
  * I want to eat less than 15 jellybeans a day
  * I want to say less than 3 curse words a day
* If a user is missing a record for a habit for the previous day, show them a message on their dashboard that lets them know and asks them to put in the record. Make it easy to jump from that message to the form to enter the data.
* Use the [new `constraints` option for models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/constraints/) with `UniqueConstraint` to make the habit records unique by user, habit, and day.

### How much of this is JavaScript?

You can make your forms a lot more usable by adding JavaScript -- to begin with, you can have a button for making a record that then shows a form without reloading the page.

If you want to add charts to your habits, you'll definitely need JavaScript. Check out [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Project 3: Django Music Collection

Create an application to keep track of all the music albums you own. You can choose what fields each album should have, but it should have at least these three:

- title
- artist
- year released

Your Django app should allow you to do the following:

- See a list of all albums (this should be your homepage)
- Create a new album
- See a detail page for one existing album
- Edit an existing album
- Delete an existing album

Your app should have at least minimal styling using a CSS library like Tachyons or Bootstrap.

A good place to start is planning out your model and making sure you can make an Album object in the console. Make some simple wireframes to sketch out the different functions of the app on the list above, and the urls (and corresponding view functions) you will need to make each page show up. Start with the home page.

### Spicy options 🌶️🌶️🌶️

- Add an Artist model and create a foreign key on the Album model to associate the two.
  - Show the Artist and their other albums on the album detail page, with links to those album detail pages.
- Create an way to mark an album with a star rating.
- Add an option to sort all albums on the list page by title, year, or artist.

## Getting up and running

In your project directory, run the following to install the project dependencies, set up your virtual environment, and run initial migrations. Note that any text enclosed in '<' and '>'
is not meant to be read literally, but refers to choices you make depending on which project you chose.

```
> pipenv install --python 3.8
> pipenv shell
> pipenv install django django-extensions django-debug-toolbar django-environ
> django-admin startproject <trackerapp OR musicapp OR snippetapp>
> cd <trackerapp OR musicapp OR snippetapp>
> mkdir templates
> mkdir static
> python3 manage.py startapp <habits OR albums OR snippets>
```

If you decide you want a custom user class, you should also run

```
> python3 manage.py startapp users
```

Finally, enter

```
> python3 manage.py migrate
```

Don't forget to have ONE team member run these commands, then push their repo for others to pull down.

### Django Project Template

This project was generated from the Momentum Django project template. This template sets up some minimal changes:

- [django-extensions](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [django-debug-toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are both installed and set up.
- [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is set up and the `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `DATABASES` settings are set by this package.
- There is a custom user model defined in `users.models.User`.
- There is a `templates/` and a `static/` directory at the top level, both of which are set up to be used.
- A `.gitignore` file is provided.
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is used to manage dependencies.
